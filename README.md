# TestDesign
Optimal *Test Design* Approach to Fixed and Adaptive Test Construction


 Founded on the optimal test design framework, the `TestDesign` package allows for constructing fixed test forms and simulating adaptive tests to the same test specifications with complex sets of constraints. This approach can render a variety of testing formats with different levels of adaptativeness and relative efficiency. This package provides several item banks from real-world testing scenarios.
